Subject: Copilot Implementation Plan & Next Steps

Hi team,

A new Copilot implementation plan has been added to our repository to streamline automation and collaboration. Please review the following:

- **Instructions & Plan:**
  - [copilot-instructions.md](../blob/16-wow/.github/copilot-instructions.md)
  - [ImplementationPlan.md](../blob/16-wow/ImplementationPlan.md)
- **GitHub Issue Template:**
  - [copilot-implementation-plan.md](../blob/16-wow/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/copilot-implementation-plan.md)

**Action Items:**
- Open a new GitHub Issue using the template above, label it appropriately, and assign as needed.
- Reference the plan for guidance and use Copilot to accelerate implementation.

Let me know if you have questions or suggestions for further optimization.

Best,
The Automation Team
