# Implementation Plan: Copilot Context, Issue, and Stakeholder Communication

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to ensure Copilot and contributors have the necessary context for new automation or collaborative tasks. It also describes how to track and communicate progress with the team.

## Steps

### 1. Update Copilot Instructions

- Add a clear implementation plan and task breakdown to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (or a dedicated file).
- Ensure the plan is actionable and easy to follow for both Copilot and human contributors.

### 2. Create a GitHub Issue

- Open an issue in the repository summarizing the implementation plan and tasks.
- Link to the instructions file for full context.
- Label the issue appropriately (e.g., `copilot`, `automation`, `planning`).

### 3. Share the Plan with Stakeholders

- Notify the team via email or messaging platform about the new issue and plan.
- Encourage use of Copilot to accelerate the work and reference the plan for guidance.
