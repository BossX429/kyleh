# Implementation Plan: Copilot Context, Issue, and Stakeholder Communication

This issue tracks the implementation of a clear Copilot context and communication workflow for this repository.

## Steps

1. **Update Copilot Instructions**
    - Add a clear implementation plan and task breakdown to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (or a dedicated file).
    - Ensure the plan is actionable and easy to follow for both Copilot and human contributors.
    - See: [`copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) and [`ImplementationPlan.md`](ImplementationPlan.md)

2. **Create a GitHub Issue**
    - Open this issue summarizing the implementation plan and tasks.
    - Link to the instructions file for full context.
    - Label the issue appropriately (e.g., `copilot`, `automation`, `planning`).

3. **Share the Plan with Stakeholders**
    - Notify the team via email or messaging platform about this issue and the plan.
    - Encourage use of Copilot to accelerate the work and reference the plan for guidance.
